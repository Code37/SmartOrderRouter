# SmartOrderRouter
A Smart Order Router implementation based on research paper by A. Adhami (see doc folder).  This project does not 'copy-n-paste' design and implementation discussed in the paper.  I plan on highlighting my changes. 

## Motivation
I started out with followng questions in my mind:<br>
What is a Smart Order Router (SOR)? What is a big deal? <br>
Java is becoming boring because of my day job :) Is there something new out there for low latency development? <br>
What is new in C++11? <br>

### Objective
Develop an *ultra low latency Smart Order Router (SOR)* for *Linux*. Use *test driven development* methodology and use *C++11* as the prmary implemenation language. Use *multi-threading* and *lock free* datastructures to acheive *micro-second* performance.

### Conflict Of Interest
There are none with my day job. All the research and work is done outside of working hours.  My day job is developing Algo trading application in Java where trading algorithms run.  I have previous knowledge of trading algos but I don't have access to the algo code that runs on my system.  SOR development team is different and I don't have access to any part of that system. 

### Timeline
A solid implementaiton will take a while since I have a day job and a family.  However, my mindset is that I will learn something even if I don't get to finish.

### Environment
1) Intel i7-6500, 16gb ram, 512 gb SSD<br>
2) Windows 10 - cheaper than other alternatives where I live and easier to carry on the go.<br>
3) cygwin<br>
4) g++ 2.9.3 w/ C++11 flags<br>
5) Git and GitHub <br>
